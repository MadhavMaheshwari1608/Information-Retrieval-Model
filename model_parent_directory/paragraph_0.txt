 Mr. Gandhi, in declaring the school open, said he was very glad to perform the ceremony. He heard from Mr. Shyam Lal Nehru that the school would be called Tilak Vidyalaya instead of National High School. No man made so much self sacrifice for swaraj as Mr. Tilak 2 and it was in the fitness of things that it should be named after the great patriot. If college students came they would open a college also. The school would take up the teaching of subjects which were taught in other schools. He then announced the names of the members of the executive committee of the school, which consisted of Pandit Motilal Nehru, president, and Messrs Jawahar Lal Nehru, Mohan Lal Nehru, Shyam Lal Nehru and Gauri Shankar Misra, members. Continuing, he said there were 15 teachers, some possessing degrees, and he thought that they were all men of good character. If the teachers were good, the school would prosper. Those who promised to serve in the school must forget other things. In some schools teachers used to do outside work besides their school work. That should not be the case there. The teachers in the National School must concentrate their attention on school work. The students would not get any furniture in the school. The Government had taught them the bad habit of using furniture, but they must be prepared to use asanas 3 only. They must show that they were superior to the boys of the other schools by their learning and character. They would not get any comforts in that institution. If necessity arose, the students must study under the trees in the open air, and, in his opinion the old tradition of India insisted upon that point. In ancient times, when the rainy season arrived the students used to work on farms. He was glad to find that typewriting, shorthand and spinning and weaving also found a place in the school course. Boys would have to learn both the scripts, Urdu and Devanagari.
