 beone which will instruct [the pupil] in the main professions and religions of India. A friend has expressed his willingness to bear all the expenses of such a school. He desires that in this school free primary education should be provided to children in Ahmedabad. He wants that there should be not one but many such schools in Ahmedabad. We think land will be available near Ahmedabad and a building can be put up, but we know that it will be difficult to find well educated teachers possessing good character. We submit to the educated classes of Gujarat that they would do well to turn their eyes in this direction. In Gujarat, these classes do not make one fourth the self sacrifice they do in Maharashtra. It is not suggested at all in our friends scheme that no salaries should be paid. It provides for the teachers livelihood, but a teacher who cannot fix a limit for his income cannot identify himself completely with the school. If anyone from the educated classes of Gujarat wish to devote their life to such education, they should write to the Secretary, the National Education Section. If we get teachers of the right kind, we shall shortly see in Ahmedabad such a school imparting national education. The children attending this school will live in their homes; they will attend school only during school hours. The same may be understood for the teachers. The National School running as part of the Satyagraha Ashram will have no connection with our friends scheme save that the same educational pattern will obtain in both. In the Satyagraha Ashram school, the aim is to obtain complete control of the pupils and train teachers from among them. The object of the school now under consideration will be merely to impart primary education to children in Ahmedabad.
